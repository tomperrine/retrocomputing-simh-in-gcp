# retrocomputing-simh-in-gcp
Scripts for running legacy operating systems, using SIMH, in GCP

This project includes the source code and examples from my
"Retrocomputing Using SIMH" series at https://thuktun.wordpress.com

The scripts here can be used to create GCP instances, install an
operating system, build and install SIMH, and (finally) run an
operating system withing the emulator.
